## Project for Maven toys
My current training at Utiva included a Capstone Project focused on the Maven toys stores dataset. Sales & inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys, including information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.

## Problem statement 
-  Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations? 
- 2. How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?
- 3. Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?
